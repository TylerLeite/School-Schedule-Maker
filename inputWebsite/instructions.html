	            </header>

                <content>
	                <p>
	                    The Pierrepont Scheduler&trade; is a brand new technology that reduces the
	                    amount of time of scheduling all of the classes for students by up to 
	                    7000% and guarantees no embarassing situations where two classes are 
	                    scheduled to take place in the same room at the same time. The Pierrepont
	                    Scheduler&trade; is specifically designed to make your life as easy as
	                    possible, but the method of input may take some explanation. Don't worry,
	                    though, I'm here to help.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>
	                    The scheduler works by taking a list of classes and constructing lists of
	                    students, teachers, rooms, and courses based on the input. It does all of
	                    this automatically so that you, the user, only have to worry about putting
	                    people in the right class and typing carefully. It is important to note
	                    that due to the dynamic nature of the scheduler, there is no way for it to
	                    tell if you've mistyped a student or course name. As such, we at CS3 inc.
	                    recommend that you triple check all names before hitting submit. Changing
	                    a name by hand can be a tedious process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    For step 1, go to the "Courses" tab and simply input the name of a course,
	                    how often it meets, the teacher's name, all students' names, and all rooms
	                    that the class can take place in. NOTE: You must, of course, use full names
	                    of people and courses. The scheduler will treat a teacher named Jack Smith
	                    the same as a student named Jack Smith.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second step of the scheduling process is to tell the scheduler about
                        teacher restrictions. If a teacher cannot be in school on a day or at a
                        time, you must use the form in the "Teachers" tab to indicate so. In
                        order to toggle all spaces, check the box in the upper left corner. To
                        toggle a whole day at a time, simply check the box next to that day. You
                        can also check indiviudual times by clicking it's respective box.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p>
                        The third and final step is to simply run the scheduler.jar file. This
                        requires Java. Your computer should already have it installed, but if
                        not, you can download it from: <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank">
                        http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a> The output will be in the
                        form of html files which can be clicked on to open them in your default
                        web browser. You can use this information to make schedules in whatever
                        format you prefer, it is just a middleman of sorts to give you all the
                        information you need to make a nice looking schedule.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Extra things</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        This is where we tell you about how to manually add a new room and fix 
                        mistakes.
